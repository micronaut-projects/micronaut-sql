Hibernate uses a proxy object to implement lazy loading with a default implementation generating a proxy during the runtime.

This has a few disadvantages:

* Runtime class generation can affect startup and runtime performance
* Environments like GraalVM don't support it

If you wish to use lazy entity associations and avoid runtime proxies you can enable compile-time proxies:
[source,yaml]
----
jpa:
  default:
    compile-time-hibernate-proxies: true
----

Compile-time proxies require for an entity which needs to have a proxy to be annotated with `@GenerateProxy`:

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Pet {

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Owner owner;

    //...
}
----

The entity `Owner` needs to be annotated with `@GenerateProxy` to have a proxy generated and the compile-time.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@GenerateProxy
public class Owner {
    //...
}
----

[NOTE]
Compile-time proxies are enabled by default for GraalVM environment.
