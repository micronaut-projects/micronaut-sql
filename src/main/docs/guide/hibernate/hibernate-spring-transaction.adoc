Since 2.0, by default Micronaut-based transaction management is enabled. Thus on any service you can use the `io.micronaut.transaction.annotation.TransactionalAdvice` annotation (or the `javax.transaction.Transactional` annotation if you include the `micronaut-data-processor` dependency in your annotation processor configuration).

If you wish to use Spring-based transaction management instead you should add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-hibernate-jpa-spring[groupId="io.micronaut.sql"]

Which will enable configuration of the Spring transaction management instead.
