This section documents breaking changes between Micronaut-SQL versions.

== 6.0.0

Micronaut SQL no longer exposes the following dependencies in the BOM:

- `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ucp`
- `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8`
- `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc11`

The libraries for `ucp` and `ojdbc11` are now exposed by the BOM for Micronaut Oracle Cloud. The `ojdbc8` library is not compatible with Java 17 and has been removed altogether.
