You can disable Micronaut Data Sources, for example in a test, by setting `datasources.<datasource-name>.enabled` to `false`.

Please note that such test should have `@MicronautTest(transactional = false)` because required transaction beans won't be available
because there is no datasource and connection available in the context.
