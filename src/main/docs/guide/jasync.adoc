Micronaut supports asynchronous access to PostgreSQL and MySQL using https://github.com/jasync-sql/jasync-sql[jasync-sql], allowing to handle many database connections with a single thread.

== Configuring jasync-sql Client
[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `jasync-sql` feature to configure the Jasync PostgreSQL and MySQL client in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features jasync-sql
----
====

To configure the Jasync client you should first add `jasync-sql` module to your classpath:

dependency:micronaut-jasync-sql[groupId="io.micronaut.sql"]

You should then configure the https://github.com/jasync-sql/jasync-sql/wiki/Configuring-and-Managing-Connections[`PoolOptions`] of the database server you wish to communicate with in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
jasync:
    client:
        port: 5432
        host: the-host
        database: the-db
        username: test
        password: test
        maxActiveConnections: 5
----

Once you have the above configuration in place then you can inject the `com.github.jasync.sql.db.Connection` bean. The following is the simplest way to connect:

[source,groovy]
----
include::jasync-sql/src/test/groovy/io/micronaut/configuration/jasync/JasyncSpec.groovy[tags=query,indent=0]
----

<1> `client` is an instance of the `com.github.jasync.sql.db.Connection` bean.

For more information on running queries on using the client please read the "Running queries" section in the documentation of https://github.com/jasync-sql/jasync-sql/wiki/Executing-Statements[jasync-sql].

== Database Health Checks

When the `jasync-sql` module is activated a api:configuration.jasync.health.JasyncHealthIndicator[] is activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and api:health.CurrentHealthStatus[] interface resolving the health of the connection.

The only configuration option supported is to enable or disable the indicator by the `endpoints.health.jasync.enabled` key.

See the section on the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] for more information.
