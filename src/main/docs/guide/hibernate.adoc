==== Setting up a Hibernate/JPA EntityManager

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `hibernate-jpa` feature to include a Hibernate JPA configuration in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features hibernate-jpa
----
====

Micronaut features built in support for configuring a http://hibernate.org[Hibernate] / JPA `EntityManager` that builds on the <<jdbc, SQL DataSource support>>.

Once you have <<jdbc, configured one or many DataSources>> to use Hibernate, you will need to add the `hibernate-jpa` dependency to your build configuration:

dependency:micronaut-hibernate-jpa[groupId="io.micronaut.sql"]

And that is it. For each registered SQL `DataSource`, Micronaut will configure the following beans using api:configuration.hibernate.jpa.EntityManagerFactoryBean[]:

* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/registry/StandardServiceRegistry.html[StandardServiceRegistry] - The Hibernate `StandardServiceRegistry`
* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataSources.html[MetadataSources] - The Hibernate `MetadataSources`
* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/SessionFactoryBuilder.html[SessionFactoryBuilder] - The Hibernate `SessionFactoryBuilder`
* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/SessionFactory.html[SessionFactory] - The Hibernate `SessionFactory` bean which also implements the JPA `EntityManagerFactory` interface.

==== Injecting an EntityManager or Hibernate Session

You can use the `javax.persistence.PersistenceContext` annotation to inject an `EntityManager` (or Hibernate `Session`). To do so you need to make sure the JPA annotations are on the `annotationProcessor` path in your build:

[source,groovy]
.Adding the JPA dependency to `annotationProcessor` in Gradle
----
annotationProcessor "jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:2.2"
----

[source,java]
.Using `@PersistenceContext`
----
@PersistenceContext
EntityManager entityManager;

@PersistenceContext(name = "other")
EntityManager otherManager;
----

Micronaut will inject a compile time scoped proxy that retrieves the `EntityManager` associated with the current transaction when using https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html[@Transactional] (see "Using Spring Transaction Management" below).

Note the examples above use field injection, since the `@PersistenceContext` annotation does not support declaration on a parameter of a constructor or method argument. Therefore if you wish to instead use constructor or method injection you must use the ann:configuration.hibernate.jpa.scope.CurrentSession[] instead:

[source,java]
.Using `@CurrentSession` for constructor injection
----
public MyService(@CurrentSession EntityManager entityManager) {
     this.entityManager = entityManager;
}
----


==== Customizing Hibernate / JPA Configuration

There are several different ways you can customize and configure how the `SessionFactory` is built. The easiest way is via configuration in `application.yml`. The following configuration demonstrates an example:

.Configuring Hibernate Properties
[source,yaml]
----
datasources:
    default:
        name: 'mydb'
jpa:
    default:
        entity-scan:
            packages:
                - 'foo.bar'
                - 'foo.baz'
        properties:
            hibernate:
                hbm2ddl:
                    auto: update
                show_sql: true
----

The above example configures the packages to be scanned and sets properties to be passed to Hibernate. As you can see these are done on a per `DataSource` basis. Refer to the api:configuration.hibernate.jpa.JpaConfiguration[] configuration class for the possible options.

If you need even further control over how the `SessionFactory` is built then you can register api:context.event.BeanCreatedEventListener[] beans that listen for the creation of the link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/SessionFactoryBuilder.html[SessionFactoryBuilder], link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataSources.html[MetadataSources] etc. and apply your custom configuration in the listener.

You may also optionally create beans of type link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/integrator/spi/Integrator.html[Integrator] and link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/Interceptor.html[Interceptor] and these will be picked up and injected automatically.

==== Entity Scan Configuration

Since 1.2 of this library Entity scan configuration is more flexible and it is possible to do reflection free scanning that works on GraalVM substrate.

The default configuration will look for all classes compiled by Micronaut that include the `@Entity` annotation.

If you wish to limit the packages to include in a particular JPA entity manager you can do so with the `entity-scan` configuration option:

.Limiting Entity Scan
[source,yaml]
----
jpa:
    default:
        entity-scan:
            packages:
                - 'foo.bar'
----

The above configuration limits the search to only classes in the `foo.bar` package. Note that if classes are not compiled by Micronaut they will not be found. There are two ways to resolve this, one is to generate introspection metadata for the external classes. For example you can place in this on your `Application` class:

.Generating Introspection Metadata for External Classes
[source,java]
----
@Introspected(packages="foo.bar")
----

This will generate introspection metadata for all classes in the `foo.bar` package.

If this option doesn't work for you, you can instead enable full classpath scanning using the `classpath` property:

.Enabling Full Classpath Scanning
[source,yaml]
----
jpa:
    default:
        entity-scan:
            classpath: true
            packages:
                - 'foo.bar'
----

Note that this approach has the following disadvantages:

* It is slower, since Micronaut has to search through JAR files and scan class files with ASM
* It does not work in GraalVM substrate.

==== Using compile-time Hibernate proxies

Hibernate uses a proxy object to implement lazy loading with a default implementation generating a proxy during the runtime.

This has a few disadvantages:

* Runtime class generation can affect startup and runtime performance
* Environments like GraalVM don't support it

If you wish to use lazy entity associations and avoid runtime proxies you can enable compile-time proxies:
[source,yaml]
----
jpa:
  default:
    compile-time-hibernate-proxies: true
----

Compile-time proxies require for an entity which needs to have a proxy to be annotated with `@GenerateProxy`:

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Pet {

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Owner owner;

    //...
}
----

The entity `Owner` needs to be annotated with `@GenerateProxy` to have a proxy generated and the compile-time.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@GenerateProxy
public class Owner {
    //...
}
----

[NOTE]
Compile-time proxies are enabled by default for GraalVM environment.


==== Using Spring Transaction Management

Since 2.0, by default Micronaut-based transaction management is enabled. Thus on any service you can use the `io.micronaut.transaction.annotation.TransactionalAdvice` annotation (or the `javax.transaction.Transactional` annotation if you include the `micronaut-data-processor` dependency in your annotation processor configuration).

If you wish to use Spring-based transaction management instead you should add the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-hibernate-jpa-spring[groupId="io.micronaut.sql"]

Which will enable configuration of the Spring transaction management instead.

==== Understanding LazyInitializationException

Micronaut is built on Netty which is based on a non-blocking, event loop model. JDBC and Hibernate are blocking APIs and hence when they are used in a Micronaut application the work is shifted to a blocking I/O thread pool.

When using https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html[@Transactional] the Hibernate `Session` will only be open for the duration of this method execution and then will automatically be closed. This ensures that the blocking operation is kept as short as possible.

There is no notion of OpenSessionInView (OSIV) in Micronaut and never will be, since it is https://vladmihalcea.com/the-open-session-in-view-anti-pattern/[sub-optimal and not recommended]. You should optimize the queries that you write to return all the necessary data Micronaut will need to encode your objects into JSON either by using the appropriate join queries or using a https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-projection-query-to-a-dto-with-jpa-and-hibernate/[data transfer object (DTO)].

If you encounter a `LazyInitializationException` when returning a Hibernate entity from a method it is an indication that your query is suboptimal and you should perform a join.
