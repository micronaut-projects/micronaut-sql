You can define additional beans which will be used when the `Jdbi` object is created.
Only beans with a `Named` qualifier name with the same name as the data source name will be used.

Micronaut will look for the following bean types:

* link:{jdbiapi}/org/jdbi/v3/core/transaction/TransactionHandler.html[TransactionHandler]
* link:{jdbiapi}/org/jdbi/v3/core/statement/StatementBuilderFactory.html[StatementBuilderFactory]
* api:configuration.jdbi.JdbiCustomizer[JdbiCustomizer]
