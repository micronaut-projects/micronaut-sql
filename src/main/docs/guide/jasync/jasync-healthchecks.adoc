When the `jasync-sql` module is activated a api:configuration.jasync.health.JasyncHealthIndicator[] is activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and api:health.CurrentHealthStatus[] interface resolving the health of the connection.

The only configuration option supported is to enable or disable the indicator by the `endpoints.health.jasync.enabled` key.

See the section on the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] for more information.
